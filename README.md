# Automating Cisco Meraki Operations using APIs
This project contains all the demo files for the course,
sorted by module. Be sure to explore these after the course to
further your understanding.

Be sure to specify the `MERAKI_API_KEY` environment variable
before using any of these Python scripts. This API key
is required to access the API and is consumed by the
`meraki_helpers` module.
